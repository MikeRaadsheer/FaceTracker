"# FaceTracker" 

## Adding a person

To add a person add pictured of their face (crop out the background) and put them in their respective folder.
To have the program recognize this person you need to run the "faces_train.py" script.
NOTE: It's important to have as much data as possible as the face tracker will have a lot of difficuly recognizing someone without a great amount of data.
